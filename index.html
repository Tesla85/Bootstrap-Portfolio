                            <p class="p">
                                I am originally from Cincinnati Ohio. I moved down south to the Carolinas when I was 13.
                                I have been back and forth between the Carlinas and Tennessee since that time, from Fort Mill, SC, to 
                                Charlotte, NC to Koxville, TN to Nashville, TN.
                            </p>
                            <p class="p">
                                In 2004 I graduated High School in Fort Mill and went on to attend the University of Tennessee in Knoxville.
                                From there I graduated with a BA in Phsychology in 2009. The job market was not fantastic at the time of my graduation, and I 
                                ended up working several part time jobs to get by. It wasn't until two years later in 2011 that I decided to obtain my Insurance Adjusters license
                                in order to be able to work a single job that allowed me to make a comfortable living. Since that time, I have been working in an industry out of necessity, with no love for my work. 
                                I wanted to get into an industry that would not only allow me to make a decent living, but also would allow me to enjoy my work and pursue creativity and inovation. I finaly made the decision that it was time to change careers.
                                With this class, I hope to be able to realize my dream of being able to not only provide a comfortable life for myself and my family,
                                but to be able to finaly pursue my dreams of becoming an entrepreneur or working for a company in a field in which I enjoy.
